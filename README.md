# CSE331
# Hw2
this is due monday at midnight
This is a bracnh from zacks repository
Many changes will be applied to the insertion function as well as 
The quick sort
The instertion function has a mistake; it suppose to start form j=2
The quicksort must have a partition function; I don't think swap function 
is doing the same purpose
make sure it rruns on the online server
Commit changes and notify the other to pull it from github
